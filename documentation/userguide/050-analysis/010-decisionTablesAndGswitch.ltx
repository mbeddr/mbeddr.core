\chapter{mbeddr.analyses --- Default Formal Analyses}

\label{details_dectabverification}

Besides improvements in productivity, the higher level extensions of C allow the
definition of automatic and usable formal analyses. In this chapter we describe
the use of these analyses.

\section{Checking Decision Tables}


\subsection{Installation}

Decision tables checking is based on the Yices 1 SMT solver:\\
\ic{http://yices.csl.sri.com/download.shtml}

To be able to use these analyses, the solver has to be installed on your machine
and available in the search path.


\subsection{Available Analyses}

A decision table is a more elegant and explicit way of coding two dimensional
choices. Internally they are represented as nested \ic{if}-statements. For
decision tables we define two analyses:

\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Completeness} checks if the decision table covers all possible cases.
\item {\bf Consistency} checks if there are cases for which two cells of the decision table can 
be active at the same time.
\end{enumerate}

As long as the expressions used as conditions are "simple", the above analyses
can be automatically performed by using an SMT (satisfiability modulo theories)
solve.\markus{We should explain what simple means (we have described it in
some paper from which we can copy it)}

\subsection{Performing the Analyses}

The first step for analyzing decision tables is to add the devkit
\ic{com.mbeddr.analyses.dectab} to the model that contains the decision table.

  \includegraphics[width=0.6\columnwidth]{figures/analyses/decTabDevKitConfig.png}
\end{center}

Once the devkit is added to the model, you can mark a decision table as
\ic{verifiable} by using an intention on the left-upper corner of the decision
table. Once the \ic{verifiable} flag is set it will be displayed on the
right-hand-side of the table (underlined with red in the figure below).

\begin{center} 
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{figures/analyses/decTabMarkAsVerifiable.png}
\end{center}

On a decision table marked as verifiable, the verification can be run with the
help of a context menu entry.

\end{center}

Once the action is started, the corresponding Yices code is generated, Yices is
started in the background and the results of the verification results will be
lifted (i.e. interpreted in the context of the decision table) and presented in
a separate window:

\begin{center} 
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\columnwidth]{figures/analyses/decTabResult.png}
\end{center}

Above we had mentioned that the expressions in the decision table have to be
"simple". More specifically, the expressions have to \emph{linear}. If they are
not, the table cannot be analyzed. A set of automatic checks are performed by
MPS to assure that the conditions used in the top line and left column of the
decision table meet the linearity limitations. If they are not, an error message
is displayed with an explanation about the cause. In this case the completeness
and consistency analyses cannot be run.

\end{center}

\paragraph{gswitch} A \ic{gswitch} (which is short for generic switch) is
essentially a set of \ic{if}-statements expressed with a more concise syntax. It
can also be seen as a one-dimensional decision table. Consequently, the same
analyses are available: after marking a \ic{gswitch} as \ic{verifiable}
(using an intention) the verification can be started: 

\begin{center} 
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{figures/analyses/gswitchVerifyAction.png}
\end{center}

The verification results concerning the completeness of the gswitch are shown in
a window. The conditions used in the gswitch should have "the same form" as
those used in the decision tables.
