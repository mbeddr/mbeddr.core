### Changed

* To avoid deadlocks, screenshots are now rendered from a Make facet rather than from the generator.
* Any screenshots that fail to render will cause the build to fail.
* The concepts [SectionAsImageParagraph](http://127.0.0.1:63320/node?ref=r%3A48b6c04c-173b-45da-963f-54fbbdb59cfc%28com.mbeddr.doc.self.structure%29%2F6416473402306197330)
  and [Visualization](http://127.0.0.1:63320/node?ref=r%3A5f7188a9-e7b4-4a2e-bef9-38d2cf379fdc%28com.mbeddr.doc.structure%29%2F2588579461812060090)
  now also use correct generation paths inside the `doc_gen` folder.

### Fixed
* Visualization of glossary term dependencies (com.mbeddr.doc.terms). 
* Doc aspect: Activate editor extensions for the tools' editor component (styles like margin and border from celllayout work now).

## com.mbeddr.core

### Added

* `CellEditorScreenshooter#takeScreenshotSynchronously` method that renders screenshots synchronously in the caller's
  thread.

* Documentation xhtml generator: links are now generated to referenced documents not only in the table of contents but also in the document itself.

### Fixed

Actionsfilter: The profiles are now correctly saved in the [configuration directory](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/mps/directories-used-by-the-ide-to-store-settings-caches-plugins-and-logs.html#config-directory).
