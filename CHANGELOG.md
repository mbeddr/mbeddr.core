# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is _loosely_ based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). The project does _not_ follow
Semantic Versioning and the changes are simply documented in reverse chronological order, grouped by calendar month.

# April 2023

## com.mbeddr.doc

### Fixed

* @doc\[some document\] causes broken build unless a "some document" was also used in include.

### Changed

# March 2023

## com.mbeddr.mpsutil

### Changed

* `c.m.m.xml.fix`: Go back to the old behavior of escaping all special characters in the text. There is an XMLExtension point which can be used to revert this change.

## com.mbeddr.doc

### Fixed

* Resource editor by default uses forward slashes instead of platform-specific forward and backward slashes

## General

## com.mbeddr.doc.aspect

### Added

* There is a new extensions point DocumentationAspectConfiguration with a method showReferenceConceptDocumentation. When the method is set to true, the documentation for the reference's concept is shown and not the referenced node (this is the old standard behavior).

### Fixed

## com.mbeddr.mpsutil.hyperlink

### Fixed

* Fix issues with loading and unloading the language.

## com.mbeddr.analyses

## com.mbeddr.mpsutil.logicalChild

* Added two interfaces: ILogicalChild and ILogicalChildOwner to define child relation between nodes in different roots.

# February 2023

## com.mbeddr.mpsutil

### Changed

* `c.m.m.xml.fix`: in 2021.3.2 the `jetbrains.mps.core.xml` language escapes the generated XML automatically and
  the escaping functionality of `xml.fix` is no longer necessary and is removed. However, the auto-escaping contains
  a bug in 2021.3 (fixed in 2022.2) where `&quot;` is incorrectly escaped as `&amp;quot;` and a new workaround is
  introduced for this bug.
* Documentation: replace ModuleIdentity with ModulePointer in ModuleRefWord. This was a deprecated concept.

### Fixed

* Datepicker: Fix entering dates in the datepicker field (#1359).
* Trace explorer: don't try to highlight a node when there is no node in the tool.
* Trace explorer: Fix exception that occured when the rerun button is pressed when there is no trace.
* Fix exception `NullPointer: Cannot create configurable` in userstyles language.
* json: Added paste and import action for json snippets and files.

## com.mbeddr.core.base

## com.mbeddr.mpsutil

"Copy sources to clipboard". It was previously set to "Zoom In".

## com.mbeddr.doc

### Changed

* To avoid deadlocks, screenshots are now rendered from a Make facet rather than from the generator.
* Any screenshots that fail to render will cause the build to fail.
* The concepts [SectionAsImageParagraph](http://127.0.0.1:63320/node?ref=r%3A48b6c04c-173b-45da-963f-54fbbdb59cfc%28com.mbeddr.doc.self.structure%29%2F6416473402306197330)
  and [Visualization](http://127.0.0.1:63320/node?ref=r%3A5f7188a9-e7b4-4a2e-bef9-38d2cf379fdc%28com.mbeddr.doc.structure%29%2F2588579461812060090)
  now also use correct generation paths inside the `doc_gen` folder.

### Fixed

  thread.

* Documentation xhtml generator: links are now generated to referenced documents not only in the table of contents but also in the document itself.
